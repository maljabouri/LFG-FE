## LFG - Looking For Gamers

Idea for this app is basically a tinder clone, but instead of finding partners, you will match with potential gamers to join up with in game and play together. It will be made specifically for World of Warcraft. 

I will be using one external API https://raider.io/api/ as I believe it will make building the app much easier.

I will be working on this project alone. 

I will be using a React/Mongoose stack.

### User Stories

Users should be able to sign up and make an account

Users should be able to set preferences for who they can match with (tank/healer/dps/server)

Users should be able customize profile (bio/dp)

Users should be able to view other peoples ranks (m+ score/raid progress)

Users should be able to communicate with people they have matched with

Users should be able to import their information from raider.io
